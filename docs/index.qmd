## Publications

::: {.publication-item}
### Assessing the Risk Stratification of Breast Cancer Polygenic Risk Scores in a Brazilian Cohort
:::: {.about}
This study validated a 313-variant breast cancer Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) in a Brazilian admixed population (n=853). While the PRS distribution differed from the UK Biobank reference, its predictive power was comparable (AUC ~0.62-0.66), underscoring the need for population-specific PRS validation.

### The paralogues MAGOH and MAGOHB are oncogenic factors in high-grade gliomas and safeguard the splicing of cell division and cell cycle genes
:::: {.about}
This research investigated the role of exon junction complex (EJC) paralogs MAGOH and MAGOHB in brain tumor development, finding them highly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients. Knockdown of MAGOH/MAGOHB in GBM cells altered splicing profiles, particularly affecting genes involved in cell division and proliferation. The study suggests that high MAGOH/MAGOHB levels are crucial for the splicing fidelity of genes essential for rapid cell growth in GBM, proposing these paralogs as potential therapeutic targets for GBM.

### Monoallelic deleterious MUTYH germline variants as a driver for tumorigenesis
:::: {.about}
This large-scale study of 10,389 cancer patients and 117,000 healthy individuals investigated the cancer risk associated with monoallelic pathogenic MUTYH germline variants. The findings indicate these variants contribute to tumorigenesis via somatic loss of the functional MUTYH allele. Monoallelic carriers showed a higher cancer frequency than the general population, though this varied by tumor type. The characteristic MUTYH mutational signature was present only in tumors with loss of heterozygosity. The study concludes that monoallelic MUTYH carriers have an increased, though overall low, risk of developing tumors, particularly those prone to loss of heterozygosity events like adrenal adenocarcinoma.

### Synergism of Proneurogenic miRNAs Provides a More Effective Strategy to Target Glioma Stem Cells
:::: {.about}
This study demonstrated that a combination of neurogenic miRNAs (miR-124, miR-128, miR-137) is significantly more effective than single miRNAs in suppressing glioma stem cell proliferation and promoting differentiation and radiation response. This highlights the synergistic potential of miRNA combinations for disrupting cancer phenotypes and targeting cancer-initiating cells.

### Genomic Biomarkers and Underlying Mechanism of Benefit from BCG Immunotherapy in Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
:::: {.about}
This study identified genomic biomarkers for BCG immunotherapy response in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Analyzing pre-treatment tumors (n=35), higher tumor mutation burden (TMB), neoantigen load (NAL), and deleterious DNA damage response (DDR) gene mutations correlated with improved BCG response and recurrence-free survival, suggesting their utility in predicting BCG benefit.
