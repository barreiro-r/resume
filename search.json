Knockdown of MAGOH/MAGOHB in GBM cells altered splicing profiles, particularly affecting genes involved in cell division and proliferation. The study suggests that high MAGOH/MAGOHB levels are crucial for the splicing fidelity of genes essential for rapid cell growth in GBM, proposing these paralogs as potential therapeutic targets for GBM.\n\n\n\nDOI 10.1080/15476286.2023.2221511\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis large-scale study of 10,389 cancer patients and 117,000 healthy individuals investigated the cancer risk associated with monoallelic pathogenic MUTYH germline variants. The findings indicate these variants contribute to tumorigenesis via somatic loss of the functional MUTYH allele. Monoallelic carriers showed a higher cancer frequency than the general population, though this varied by tumor type. The characteristic MUTYH mutational signature was present only in tumors with loss of heterozygosity. The study concludes that monoallelic MUTYH carriers have an increased, though overall low, risk of developing tumors, particularly those prone to loss of heterozygosity events like adrenal adenocarcinoma.\n\n\n\nDOI 10.1002/path.5829\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis study demonstrated that a combination of neurogenic miRNAs (miR-124, miR-128, miR-137) is significantly more effective than single miRNAs in suppressing glioma stem cell proliferation and promoting differentiation and radiation response. This highlights the synergistic potential of miRNA combinations for disrupting cancer phenotypes and targeting cancer-initiating cells.\n\n\n\nDOI 10.3390/cancers13020289\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis study identified genomic biomarkers for BCG immunotherapy response in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Analyzing pre-treatment tumors (n=35), higher tumor mutation burden (TMB), neoantigen load (NAL), and deleterious DNA damage response (DDR) gene mutations correlated with improved BCG response and recurrence-free survival, suggesting their utility in predicting BCG benefit.\n\n\n\nDOI 10.3233/BLC-200289"
